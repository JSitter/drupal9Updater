# Drupal9 Semi-Auto Updater
Update your Drupal9 Projects with relative ease.

This script is designed to run on crummy Hostgator Shared servers that don't want to run scripts using Python3. In order to run the updater on Hostgator sites use hostgator-runner.sh script to force the server to run the updater using a more modern version of Python.

Pass in the project root directories that contain the Drupal9 installations to update -- i.e. `./hostgator-runner.sh ../public_html/`.

This updater is still a work in progress.
